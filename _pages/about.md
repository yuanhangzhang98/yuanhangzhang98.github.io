***Revolutionizing AI with physics, unraveling physics with AI.***

Welcome to my research universe at the crossroads of physics, machine learning, and unconventional computing. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego, I am privileged to explore how physical principles can innovate AI and computing.

Computing, while deeply rooted in mathematics, truly comes to life through physics. Beyond the conventional silicon technologies, physics offers a portal to intriguing alternatives—like quantum computers using entanglement to swiftly solve intricate problems. My focus, however, in the potential of non-quantum dynamical systems. Here, the concept of long-range order among distant components introduces a new level of parallelism— this idea is at the heart of *MemComputing*. (For more insights, check out [this book](https://academic.oup.com/book/42003) and [this review paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article/123/18/180901/154864)!)

In pursuit of smarter AI, I draw inspiration from the human brain itself. Imagine computers that learn and think by mimicking how the brain uses memories to link up ideas across a wide canvas. This approach, which we call memory-induced long-range order, could lead to AI that is not only smarter but also more robust and efficient. More than just advancing technology, this research may help us decode some of the enigmas of our own cognition, narrowing the gap between human and machine intelligence.

Join me on this exhilarating journey at the frontier of technology and discovery, where we merge the best of physics and machine learning to reimagine what it means to be intelligent!
